# ARS2
ARS2 is a remote surveillance software for the android platfrom, it make use of the smart OS Android instead of implmenting complex hardware components. 
ARS2 take remote surveillace system to the next level by making it mobile, also it does not require any extra electronic componets, except for the DTMF decoders & L293D motor driver ICs to interface to the underlying Robot hardware(no micorcontrollers or processors. )
It requires only a single users, also the App can be used by a naive (non-techincal) person. 
Also, the hardware is real cheap(as it doesn't require hardware cameras and other compoents, they're provided by android devices itself. )
Anyone hopping to contribute more please do mail me your username, i'll add you as a collaborator. 
Also download the file "Remote Surveillance System.ppsx" to get a better understanding of the project.
